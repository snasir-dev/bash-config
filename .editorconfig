# Pre-requisites: Install the EditorConfig extension from the VS Code Marketplace
# Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig

# What is an editorconfig file?: https://editorconfig.org/

# This will Auto-Convert Line Endings to LF (\n) instead of default CRLF (\r\n) for all Shell Scripts (.sh) on Save in VS Code.
[*.sh]
end_of_line = lf

indent_style = space # Use spaces for indentation
indent_size = 4
insert_final_newline = true 
trim_trailing_whitespace = true # Remove trailing whitespace on save


# shfmt-specific options
# These are interpreted by shfmt directly
# See: https://github.com/mvdan/sh/blob/master/cmd/shfmt/shfmt.1.scd#examples
# Or run: `shfmt -h` for flags


shell_variant = bash
binary_next_line = true  # forces &&, ||, | to next line
switch_case_indent = true # Switch Case Statement Indent Each Case
space_redirects = true  # `> file` over `>file`
# keep_padding = true  # Preserve existing horizontal spacing between tokens (e.g., for aligning comments or columns).
# function_next_line = true  # Would make the "{" start on a new line for any function

# Optional: ignore vendor or third_party scripts
# Ignore the entire "third_party" directory when calling shfmt on directories,
# such as "shfmt -l -w .". When formatting files directly,
# like "shfmt -w third_party/foo.sh" or "shfmt --filename=third_party/foo.sh",
# the ignore logic is applied only when the --apply-ignore flag is given.
