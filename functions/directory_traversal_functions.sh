# Example:
# cd /home/user/projects/TEST # Start in TEST
# push     # Remember path /home/user/projects/TEST
# up 2     # Go up two levels to /home/user
# back     # Go back to /home/user/projects/TEST (note - back is an alias for 'cd -')
# cd /tmp  # Go to /tmp
# pop      # Return to the directory you pushed. Back in /home/user/projects/TEST
# dirs -v  # Check the directory stack (should be fewer entries now)

# `up [n]` function:  Go up a specific number of directory levels.

#    - `up 2`: Goes up two levels (same as 'cd ../..', or '...').

# Dynamic Jump (j)

# Allows me to dynamically jump between directories within my current filepath.
# For example in ~/Documents/@MAIN-WORKSPACE. just do "j <dirname>" so "j manifests" or any directory name "j @main-workspace", if it exists within @MAIN-WORKSPACE will try to go to it. Also added autocompletion. Can do "j <tab>" to see available directories to jump to.

# Create an associative array to store path mappings
#
# Jumps to a parent directory within the current file path.
# Works dynamically with any directory you are in.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# If you are in: /c/Users/Syed/Documents/Work/ProjectA/src
# Running 'j Documents' will take you to: /c/Users/Syed/Documents
# ===============

# BASH AUTOCOMPLETION SETUP for "j()"
# Autocompletion function for 'j'. This give yous ability to tab complete REGARDLESS of the case-sensitivity of the directory names. if you have '/c/Users/Syed/Documents/@MAIN-WORKSPACE' can do "j u" and it will auto complete "j user" and will go there.
# Minor downside is when you see tab results, it will show duplicates due to case-sensitivity but convenience outweighs the negative.

# This function provides the logic for Bash's programmable tab completion.
# It is automatically triggered by Bash when you press the Tab key after
# typing the `j` command. This version enables case-insensitive completion
# at the cost of showing duplicate suggestions in the list.

  # populate the `j_path_mappings` associative array. This ensures the
  # completion suggestions are always relevant to your current location.

  # Bash provides special variables for completion functions.
  # - `COMP_WORDS`: An array containing all individual words on the current command line.
  # - `COMP_CWORD`: The index number of the word the cursor is currently on.
  # This line gets the word you are currently trying to complete (e.g., "Doc").
  local cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"

  # This is the final command that generates and assigns the suggestions.
  # - `COMPREPLY`: The special array variable that Bash uses to display completion options.
  # - `compgen -W "..."`: A Bash built-in that generates completions from a given Word list (`-W`).
  # - `${!j_path_mappings[*]}`: This expands to a list of all *keys* in our associative array.
  #   Since our map contains both "Documents" and "documents", both are included in this list.
  # - `-- "$cur"`: This tells `compgen` to only suggest words from the list that start
  #   with the current word under the cursor.
  COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "${!j_path_mappings[*]}" -- "$cur"))

# Register the completion function to work with the 'j' command.
