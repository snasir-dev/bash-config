# --- COMPLETIONS ---
#===============================================
# .NET CLI (dotnet) Auto-Completion Script      #
#===============================================
# Official Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/enable-tab-autocomplete
# This enables bash tab-completion for `dotnet` commands, subcommands, and options.
# Pre-requisite: Ensure `dotnet` is installed and in your PATH.
# You can install .NET on Windows with: winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8
# Completion script is built into the CLI via `dotnet complete`

# You can test the results without enabling tab completion by sending something directly to the dotnet complete command. Example: dotnet complete "dotnet a"

# if command -v dotnet &>/dev/null; then
#     source <(dotnet complete)
#     # Alternatively: eval "$(dotnet complete)"
# fi


# bash parameter completion for the dotnet CLI

#   local cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}" IFS=$'\n' # On Windows you may need to use use IFS=$'\r\n'
  local cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}" IFS=$'\r\n' # On Windows you may need to use use IFS=$'\r\n'
  local candidates

  read -d '' -ra candidates < <(dotnet complete --position "${COMP_POINT}" "${COMP_LINE}" 2>/dev/null)

# Enable .NET CLI tab completion. The script must be registered once.
# This is an example; check the official .NET docs for the latest method.
# To register: dotnet complete --install
# This sourcing logic activates it if it's installed.
# if command -v register-completions >/dev/null 2>&1; then
